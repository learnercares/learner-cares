**Hi there!**:wave:

I'm Shahid. I work as a full-time Analyst Manager. In my spare time I do open-sourcing (***normally it is about 1-2 hours***). Most of my open-source projects below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing - **to help people learn 📚**. You may use these projects to learn about Data Science and get prepared for technical interviews, or to learn Python and R syntax and start experimenting with machine learning algorithms, etc.
